# ECSE222 Lab1 - 5-bit Adder  
This is the folder for codes of 5-bit adder lab.  

# List of Contents  
1) [__g89_7_segment_decoder.vhd__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/g89_7_segment_decoder.vhd)  
> This is the VHDL file for 7 segments decoder, which transforms a 4-bit binary signal to a 7-bit binary output. The output signal may be used for 7-segment display.  
> Correctness checked. [Testing codes](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/g89_7_segment_decoder.vht)

2) [__g89_adder.vhd__  ](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/g89_adder.vhd)
> This is the VHDL file for 5-bit adder, which takes 2 2-digit hexdecimal numbers as input and displays their sum on the 7-segments display.  

3) [__g89_lab1_pin_assignment.csv__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/g89_lab1_pin_assignment.csv)  
> This is the CSV file that indicates the pin assignment.  

4) [__g89_lab1.sof__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/g89_lab1.sof)  
> This is the result of compliing all files above. It would be used when uploading codes to the development board.  

5) [__Chain_final.cdf__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/Chain_final.cdf)  
> This is the final chain file used to set up the uploading environment.  

6) [__Lab Assignment 1.pdf__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/Lab%20Assignment%201.pdf)  
> This is the assignment of the lab.
