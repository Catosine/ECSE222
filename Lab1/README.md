# [ECSE222 Lab1 - 5-bit Adder](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/Lab%20Assignment%201.pdf)  
This is the folder for codes of 5-bit adder lab. In this lab, a 4-to-7 decoder and a 4-bit hexdecimal adder is described using VHDL.  

## List of Contents  
1) [__g89_7_segment_decoder.vhd__](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/code/g89_7_segment_decoder.vhd)  
> This is the VHDL file for 7 segments decoder, which transforms a 4-bit binary signal to a 7-bit binary output. The output signal may be used for 7-segment LEDs.  
> Correctness checked. [Testing codes](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/code/g89_7_segment_decoder.vht)

2) [__g89_adder.vhd__  ](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE222---VHDL/blob/master/Lab1/code/g89_adder.vhd)
> This is the VHDL file for 5-bit adder, which takes 2 2-digit hexdecimal numbers as input and displays their sum on the 7-segments display.
