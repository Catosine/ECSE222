# ECSE222 Lab1 - 5-bit Adder  
This is the folder for codes of 5-bit adder lab.  

# List of Contents  
1) __g89_7_segment_decoder.vhd__  
> This is the VHDL file for 7 segments decoder, which transforms a 4-bit binary signal to a 7-bit binary output. The output signal may be used for 7-segment display.  

2) __g89_adder.vhd__  
> This is the VHDL file for 5-bit adder, which takes 2 2-digit hexdecimal numbers as input and displays their sum on the 7-segments display.  

3) __g89_lab1_pin_assignment.csv__  
> This is the CSV file that indicates the pin assignment.  

4) __g89_lab1.sof__  
> This is the result of compliing all files above. It would be used when uploading codes to the development board.  

5) __Chain_final.cdf__  
> This is the final chain file used to set up the uploading environment.  

6) __Lab Assignment 1.pdf__  
> This is the assignment of the lab.
